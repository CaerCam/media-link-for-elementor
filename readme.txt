Allow users to create media links in Elementor Page Builder.

== Description ==

Elementor allows you to easily place links almost everywhere and helps you find the relevant pages and posts by typing in titles or words. Creating links to media is a bit more tedious and requires you to manually browse to the Media Library, copy the media file URL, go back to Elementor and paste the URL. This plugin makes it much more easier by adding media to the autocomplete results along with pages and posts.

== Installation ==

Upload the Media Link for Elementor plugin to your blog, Activate it. Done!
